# Cinny's VSCode Pink Theme 

My customized light theme on Visual Studio Code, using pink as my base and adding some other dreamy colors.

(A sample can be found in the Screenshot in the repository. I still can't figure out how to upload an image from my local file to README.md, I copied pasted the absolute path for my image and still didn't link. Please teach me if you can!)

I am a big supporter of customizing themes because we spend so much time on our editors everyday and I think it is important to customize it the way you want it.

## Installation
It's not an extension or anything, I just made changes on top of the Default Light+ theme. 
To use it, just copy paste the settings.json file on your User Settings. 
You can also make your own changes. 


## Do It Yourself!
It is Python bases, so some colors may not be showing right.
To customize it on your own, follow these steps:
1. Select the word you want to customize --> 
2. Go to "Command Palette" --> 
3. Type in "Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes" --> 
4. Check the "scope" of the word and edit your settings in "textMateRules" accordingly -->
5. You have successfully made your own changes!
