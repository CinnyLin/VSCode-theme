# Cinny's VSCode Pink Theme 

This is my customized light theme on Visual Studio Code, using pink as my base and adding some other dreamy colors.

I am a big supporter of customizing themes because we spend so much time on our editors everyday and I think it is important to customize it the way you want it.

## Installation
It's not an extension or anything, I just made changes on top of the Default Light+ theme. 
To use it, Just copy paste the .json file on your User Settings. 
You can also make your own changes. 


## Do It Yourself!
It is Python bases, so some colors may not be showing right.
To customize it on your own, follow these steps:
1. Select the word you want to customize --> 
2. Go to "Command Palette" --> 
3. Type in "Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes" --> 
4. Check the "scope" of the word and edit your settings in "textMateRules" accordingly -->
5. You have successfully made your own changes!
