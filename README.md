## Installation

It's not an extension or anything, I just made changes on top of the Default Light+ theme.
To use it, just copy paste the settings.json file on your User Settings.
You can also make your own changes.

## Do It Yourself!

It is Python based, so some colors may not be showing right.
To customize it on your own, follow these steps:

1. Select the word you want to customize -->
2. Go to "Command Palette" -->
3. Type in "Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes" -->
4. Check the "scope" of the word and edit your settings in "textMateRules" accordingly -->
5. You have successfully made your own changes!
